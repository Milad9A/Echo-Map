Hey! üëã 

I need your help testing an app I built for my HCI course at Hochschule Bremen. It's called **EchoMap** - a navigation app that uses vibration patterns to help blind and low-vision people navigate independently.

**Could you spare 20 minutes to test it?**

## How to Help:

**1. Install the app:**
üì± **Android**: https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/b4ffd9f01e1a7553
üçé **iPhone**: *Currently having technical issues - please use Android if possible*

**Installation Help:**
- **You'll need to provide your email** - Click the link above and enter your email address
- **Check your email** for the Firebase invitation and download link
- **Android**: Allow "Install from unknown sources" when prompted
- **iPhone users**: If you have an Android device available, please use that instead. iOS testing is currently limited due to Apple's device registration requirements.
- **Still having trouble?** Text/email me and I'll help you get it working!

**2. Test these features:**
- **Vibration Test** - Try all the different haptic patterns
- **Navigation** - Set a nearby destination and follow the vibration cues
- **Settings** - Adjust vibration intensity and explore options
- **Voice features** - Test speech input/output (if available)
- **Map interface** - Check how easy it is to plan routes
- **Location services** - See how the app handles GPS permissions

**3. Bonus challenge:** Try using it with your eyes closed for 2-3 minutes to really understand the user experience!

**4. Fill out this survey:** https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNFGCIumyK1ytsKm-E5rZqMBDo-nKA0nYJhNNGUAtxWNFSAA/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=113011654477135139819

Thanks for helping out!

Best,
