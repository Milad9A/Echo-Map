Hey! üëã 

I need your help testing an app I built for my HCI course at Hochschule Bremen. It's called **EchoMap** - a navigation app that uses vibration patterns to help blind and low-vision people navigate independently.

**Could you spare 20 minutes to test it?**

## How to Help:

**1. Install the app:**
üì± **Android**: https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/b4ffd9f01e1a7553
üçé **iPhone**: https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/YOUR_IOS_FIREBASE_CODE

**Installation Help:**
- **Android (Firebase)**: Click the Android link above ‚Üí Enter your email address ‚Üí Check your email for the Firebase invitation and download link ‚Üí Allow "Install from unknown sources" when prompted
- **iPhone (Firebase)**: Click the iPhone link above ‚Üí Enter your email address ‚Üí Check your email for the Firebase invitation and download link ‚Üí Follow the installation instructions
- **Need help?** Both platforms use Firebase App Distribution - just click your platform's link and enter your email address
- **Still having trouble?** Contact me and I'll help you get it working!

**2. Test these features:**
- **Vibration Test** - Try all the different haptic patterns
- **Navigation** - Set a nearby destination and follow the vibration cues
- **Settings** - Adjust vibration intensity and explore options
- **Voice features** - Test speech input/output (if available)
- **Map interface** - Check how easy it is to plan routes
- **Location services** - See how the app handles GPS permissions

**3. Bonus challenge:** Try using it with your eyes closed for 2-3 minutes to really understand the user experience!
